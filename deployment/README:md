# Deployment

Contains a bunch of terraform to deploy our infrastrcuture that we need for manuall testing.
Can also be used as a base line when setting up your own solution.

This is not production ready, I don't save my terraform state in a remote object storage due to OSS.
You should though.

## How to use

Assumes the GCP project already exists, I was lazy so mine did.

Create a `terraform.tfvars`that looks something like this:

```.tfvars
project_id = "super-fun-project-id"
org_id     = "1234567"
eligible_principals = [
  "group:foo@example.com",
]
approver_principals = [
  "user:bar@example.com",
]
```

Apply the config

```shell
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

You might have to apply the config two times, the APIs takes some time to enable.
